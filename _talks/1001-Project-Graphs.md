Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as a fellow in the "Cycle Decompositions of Graphs" project.
As an output of this project, in my thesis titled <a href="TezGoster?key=X-M9ZoIuIoNTj2P7iY13hdNw5cvTyWen_t56XQygeEJcDBYnfQ41vyz5wd3crep4">"2-factorization of complete equipartite graphs with four and eight cycles"</a>  my supervisor <a href="https://www.gtu.edu.tr/personel/573/21919/display.aspx">Prof. Dr. sibel Ã–zkan</a>  and I proved a theorem stating that a complete multipartite graph, under certain conditions, has a factorization with cycles of length 4 and 8.
