* **Cycle Decompositions of Graphs:** Between 2013 and 2015, at Gebze Technical University, I worked as a fellow in the project called "Cycle Decompositions of Graphs" supported by TUBITAK's 1001-coded Scientific and Technological Research Projects Support Program.
As an output of this project, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.gtu.edu.tr/personel/573/21919/display.aspx">Prof. Dr. Sibel Ã–zkan</a>, I proved a theorem stating that a complete multipartite graph, under certain conditions, has a factorization with cycles of length 4 and 8 in my thesis titled "2-factorization of complete equipartite graphs with four and eight cycles". -->
