**“Atma Bağışla” (eng. Don’t Throw It Away — Donate It) Electronic Waste Recycling Project** 

Between September 2024 and November 2025, I coordinated the “Don’t Throw It Away — Donate It” electronic waste collection initiative aimed at raising awareness of e-waste pollution and promoting environmentally responsible recycling practices. The project encouraged individuals to donate unused electronic devices—such as computers, phones, monitors, small household appliances, cables, and adapters—for proper recycling. Throughout the 15-month period, all donated items were recorded, safely stored, and prepared for transfer. In total, approximately 12 kg of e-waste was collected. On 14 November 2025, the materials were delivered to the Bornova Municipality Climate Change and Zero Waste Department’s Waste Collection Center for environmentally compliant recycling. This was the first project I led, and taking an active role in it was a deeply rewarding experience.
